                             WWIV 5.0 TODO List
                 Copyright 2002-2005 WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

* More C++ classes around C data structures
* More STL string usages
* Move bputch, makeansi, bputs, ansic, and etc to WOutStream 
  (aka instead of bputs(x), sess->bout->puts(x)) [maybe]
* Let WUser take string& parameters in addition to const char * parameters
* move g_flags into WSession
* More streams usages
* Bug (crash) when adding an event when you have no events.dat 
  (plus I'm sure plenty of other things, since I don't use the events)
* NNTP Support in WWIVTelnetServer
* Type-3 Message Base Support (JAM or SQUISH)
* Cleanup /W4 warnings. (3?)
* Fix blind uploads
* Move isr1 to SmallRecord
* Make SmallRecord class with following methods: insert, delete, rebuild.
* Move rebuild_files names.lst rebuild code to SmallRecord.rebuild method.
* Move remaining status.* usages to StatusMgr
* Make a WTextFile class (either probably NOT a subclass of WFile, but wrap a WFile) and use it instead of fsh_XXX methods w/fXXX CRT calls
* Implement WFile::MoveFile on LInux
* Make WStatusMgr return the WStatus instance (from get and lock?) and not keep it a global variable.
* Use quicksort to sort names.lst
* Use STL vector or map to hold names.lst
