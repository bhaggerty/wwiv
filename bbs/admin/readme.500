WWIV 5.0 Getting Started
========================
If you already have WWIV 5.0 installed, just copy the EXE and DLL files over
your existing 4.30 installation. (please backup your previous binaries and
configuration files)

Run WWIV5TelnetServer.exe and then select the menu Edit > Preferences and setup
the information for your configuration (paths, and the starting and ending
node numbers to use for inbound telnet).  Make sure those nodes are setup
in INIT50.exe already.  Then choose File > Start Server.  Now the 
WWIV5TelnetServer (WTS) is listening on a socket and ready to spawn now 
instances of WWIV.  You do not need to keep multiple copies of WWIV running
at all times, as the WTS will spawn them as required.  Also, make sure that
all of the nodes that are telnet are configured in INIT to use COM1.

*** Be sure to read WHATSNEW.TXT for a list of all the new major features and
other changes that have happened since 4.30. ***
