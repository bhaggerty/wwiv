WWIV 5.0 (Beta-2) Getting Started
=================================
Copy all of these files into your existing WWIV 4.30/500 installation 
(don't worry, it won't overwrite anything from 4.30)

Run WWIVTelnetServer.exe and then select the menu Edit > Preferences and setup
the information for your configuration (paths, and the starting and ending
node numbers to use for inbound telnet).  Make sure those nodes are setup
in INIT50.exe already.  Then choose File > Start Server.  Now the 
WWIVTelnetServer (WTS) is listening on a socket and ready to spawn now 
instances of WWIV.  You do not need to keep multiple copies of WWIV running
at all times, as the WTS will spawn them as required.  Also, make sure that
all of the nodes that are telnet are setup in INIT to use COM1.

*** Be sure to read WHATSNEW.TXT for a list of all the new major features and
other changes that have happened since 4.X. ***

Serial I/O Support (aka using the modem) has not been tested.

Registration Passcodes:
=======================

    All registered sysops now need a Registration Passcode for the BBS.
In the past, address information was used to verify registrations.  We
found it a tedious and repetitive task to verify this information.
Since the passcode system is already required for instances beyond the
standard installation, we are using that system to verify registrations
now.  Registration numbers and passcode pairs will be used to verify
your identity as a registered sysop for SDS systems and other activities
that require registration verification.

    If you have upgraded to 4 or more instances already, your current
passcode will suffice.  If not, you will need to do one of two things:

    a.  If your current address information is the same as when you
    registered WWIV, go to http://wss.wwiv.com/passcode.htm to apply for
    your passcode.

    b.  If your registration record is not current, we will have to
    verify you one last time under the old system.  Go to
    http://wss.wwiv.com/regupdate.htm to update your information and
    your passcode will be issued when the update is completed.  You can
    also use this form to update your information at any time in the
    future should you wish to keep our database current.

    Be forewarned, WWIV v5.00 will stop operating in evaluation mode 60
days after it is installed even if a registration number is entered in
INIT.  Both registration number *and* passcode must be entered to
operate in registered mode.  After the 60 day trial, the BBS name will
be changed to "Unregistered WWIV BBS" and INIT will cease to function.
